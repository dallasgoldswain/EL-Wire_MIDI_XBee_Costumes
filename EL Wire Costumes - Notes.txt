9600,8n1, no flow control. local echo, append lf to cr.
connect (hit enter to make connection in terminal)
+++ (no enter) get OK
AT (enter) get OK

ATID = get "Personal Area Network ID"   (3332)
ATBD = get baud rate (3=9600,4=19200,5=38400,6=57600)   (6)
ATWR = Write shit to chip
ATRR = Retry Rate, 0~6.  6 = more retries, 0 = none.
ATCH = 2.4ghz channel ID.  Default is "C" (aka 0x0C, "12") (Range is 0C(12),0D,0E,0F,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,1A(26)) 
ATCN = get out of this command shit.
ATRE = reset to default values 
ATMY = my address, defaults to "0".  (0)
ATDL = "destination low" where I should broadcast to. default "0", "FFFF" to broadcast to everyone no matter what.
ATND = hey, show me all radios and stuff. ("node discovery") (my address \n serial# \n noun name \n RSSI level)
ATNI = "node identifier" set a normal name to a radio.  ATN1 My Radio Name
ATED = Show me noise "energy detect" of channels! (find open channel, higher number cleaner channel)
ATDB = "show me most recent recieved db level" (higher better) (do 2-way comm, +++, ATDB)

20120206: going ATCH19RR6


20120329 program code is going to be:
	connect at 9600,8n1, no flow, local echo, append lf to cr.
		ATCH19
		ATRR3  (just do 3 repeats of each broadcast)
		ATBD6
		ATID1337
		ATCE1 (only for the PC transmitter)
		ATCE0 (ATCE0 for the costume receivers)
		//ATA24 (transmitter for no energy scan, do allow association.)
		//ATA14 (receivers associate only to proper PAN ID and channel)
		ATA10 (fuck assoc.)
		ATA20 (fuck assoc.)
		ATNI Presence Costume [octive 0-7]
		ATDLFFFF (broadcast shit)
		WR
	reconnect at 57600
		ATNI
		ATBD
		ATCH
		ATRR


Status light on El Escudo:  I'm getting MIDI data, regardless if its "for me" or not.
Green light on radio:  Blinking means power.
Red light on radio: solid when "I hear my base station" / Off when "no transmission"

(Transmitter: No blue light anymore since its just blindly broadcasting)


for me to buy now:
(a) Parallax usb xbee board
(s) 2 el escudos
(s) 3~4 jst pairs
(a) ?1 arduino
(a) 2 adafruit xbee radio adapters (or 1 and 1 xbee rail)
(a) 1 xbee radio


20121101:
 Due to "not working right" in real life:
  New XBee Pro S1 @ 63mW transmitter
  All radios moved to Channel 0x17
  ATCH17
  ATRR3
  ATWR
